Definitions:
<ul>
<li>Obvious: Eliminate possibilities that fall directly out of the rules</li>
<li>Intersections (pointing, box/line reduction): When a digit is restricted to some set of positions (e.g. one row in a block), eliminate positions that are ruled out regardless of where the digit is in the group (e.g. eliminate rest of row).</li>
<li>Naked sets: If N cells contain only N possibilities between them, the other cells can't contain those N possibilities.</li>
<li>Fish (X-Wing, Swordfish, Jellyfish): Suppose in N rows, a digit can only appear in the same N columns. Then in those N columns, other rows are not possible.</li>
<li>Hidden singles: For each digit, see if it can only go in one place for some group</li>
